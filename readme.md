# Home Assistant by J-Lindvig
This my implementation of Home Assistant - enjoy...
## Introduction
In my setup I have 2 instances of Home Assistant, a master and a slave. They are connected using [remote homeassistant](https://github.com/lukas-hetzenecker/home-assistant-remote).
The reason why I am using 2 Home Assistants is that I have 2 IKEA TRÅDFRI Gateways and each Home Assistant can *only* control one. Off course I could use another Zigbee gateway solution, but I was offered a second Gateway very cheap.
### Hardware
 - Raspberry Pi 3B+
 - PNY 240 GB SSD USB3.1
 - IKEA TRÅDFRI Gateway
